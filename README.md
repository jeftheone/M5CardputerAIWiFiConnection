An upgrade on FelipeLima2 Cardputer firmware.

Same concept, but at the initialization, it search for avaliable SSIDs and you can type the password to connect and remember it next time.

Press ABtn to reset WiFi.

Just change the code and add your cohere API Key.

The chat seems not to use the chat history as source of information, i wonder if there is a way to make it read a .txt file from the SD card as source of data for the answers or even create one with the ask/answer history.

Im just an amateur, trying to have fun with my new cardputer. Original project: https://github.com/FelipeLima2/M5CardputerAI
